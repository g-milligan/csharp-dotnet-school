**Making sure .NET is Installed**

Do you have .NET installed on your computer?

Find out by opening the `vscode` terminal and checking if you can run the `dotnet` command in this Command Line Interface (CLI):

```
> dotnet --version
```

If you see that you have a version of dotnet, then you don't have to install it.

Example
```
5.0.400
```

Otherwise, download and install .NET. <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download>

Once installed, check to see if you have the `dotnet --version` command available after restarting `vscode`.
